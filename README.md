# Assignment_2
 


**Assignment goals**

This software is designed for the “Planning for drunks” project.

**How to run the code**

To run the code the following files must be in the users working directory:

*Drunks_go_home.py
*agentframework_drinkers.py
*drunk.plan.txt


The program runs in the command prompt as "python Drunks_go_home.py [value]" where [value] is the desired number 
of iterations.

If a non integer value is entered as the argument the program outputs an error message and runs with a default 
1000 iterations.

There are number of commands in the script that are hashed out or between triple quotes that the user can use 
to test if functions have worked and to help debugging.

**Outputs**

The output is an animation of the model where the user can view the agents fumbling their way home,
once the animation has finished and been closed by the user a density map called density_map.txt will be created.
The model will also print statements whenever an agent has found its way home, and at the end of the model.
